# Rational Number Arithmetic in MIPS Assembly

This repository contains MIPS assembly language code for performing arithmetic operations on rational numbers. The code includes four programs: `add_rational.asm`, `sub_rational.asm`, `mul_rational.asm`, and `div_rational.asm`.

## Programs

- `add_rational.asm`: Adds two rational numbers.
- `sub_rational.asm`: Subtracts two rational numbers.
- `mul_rational.asm`: Multiplies two rational numbers.
- `div_rational.asm`: Divides two rational numbers.
- 
## Programs Included

### Addition Program

**add_rational.asm**: This program adds two rational numbers and displays the result. <br />

### Subtraction Program

**sub_rational.asm**: This program subtracts two rational numbers and displays the result. <br />
https://github.com/Paniz-Peiravani/Rational-Numbers/blob/main/sub_rational.asm

### Multiplication Program

**mul_rational.asm**: This program multiplies two rational numbers and displays the result. <br />
https://github.com/Paniz-Peiravani/Rational-Numbers/blob/main/mul_rational.asm

### Division Program

**div_rational.asm**: This program divides two rational numbers and displays the result. <br />

## Usage Instructions

To use these programs, follow these general steps:

1. Load the desired program
   - `add_rational.asm`
   - `sub_rational.asm`
   - `mul_rational.asm`, 
   - `div_rational.asm`)
into your MIPS assembly simulator (e.g., MARS).
3. Assemble the program to generate the machine code.
4. Run the program.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter values for the rational numbers as instructed.
6. The program will perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and display the result.
7. If either denominator is zero, the program will display an error message:
   - Error: Denominator cannot be ZERO!!!
